# Group 4 Project

- The purpose of this is to pull player information from the Hypixel API, which stores Minecraft (an online game) Player Data.
- The User will filter the data using input from the terminal filtering on name data and game mode type.
- This application will return player name, game mode type and kill/death ratio.
- Kill/Death ratio will be calculated by a function which utilises the data from API called 'kills' and 'deaths'.
